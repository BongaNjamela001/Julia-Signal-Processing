# Julia-Signal-Processing
Compilation of Jupyter notebooks on signal processing using Julia. Analysis is performed in the time domain and frequency domain using mathematical functions such as fft() which performs the fast Fourier transform. Results from simulations of signals, convolution in the time domain and frequency domain, audio signal sampling, amplitude modulation and discrete convolution are discussed and represented graphically using the Plotly library.
